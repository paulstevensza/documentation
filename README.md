# Documentation

This is where I keep notes of stuff I'm working on. Some of it will become blog
posts on [xnode.co.za](http://xnode.co.za) while some of it will just live
here as a technical reference that I can't lose in a fit of pique with my
current blogging platform.

It covers almost everything I work on, and acts as a substitute for my
sometimes piss poor memory.

## About

I put time and effort into my research, so I'm licensing this under a
MIT license. I don't expect anything else except a mention of where you
found this and maybe a link back to my blog or this repo.
