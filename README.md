# Documentation

This is where I do my writing now, because even with a SSG, there's too much
fucking around with stuff that doesn't matter instead of just hammering out
content.

Plus: no comment software. If you see something in a "post" that doesn't
make sense or contains offensive errors, open an issue referencing the content
that annoys or intrigues you. :boom: open source.

## About

If you want to use anything you find here, go ahead. I don't even want you to
mention the source if you're using it in your own writing, or to have to pass
any links back to the original docs. You can if you like, but why bother? It's
not like a shitty post on building jails in FreeBSD is suddenly going to garner
me international fame...especially since I grokked the content out of the
documentation anyway.
