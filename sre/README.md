# SRE Documentation

The documentation in `/sre` is intended to be a loose collection of notes that I take down as we progress on the mythical
journey from sysadmin circa 1990 to sysadmin cira 2018. You may as well call it "devops" or "automation", but the spirit of
the venture is to integrate SRE principles into ops, because who doesn't love a good acronym loaded with the promise of magic?
