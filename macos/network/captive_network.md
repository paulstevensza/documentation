# Captive Network Assistant

If you're on a pay-to-use wifi network or some dumbass corporate LAN with Internet auth hanging off of Active
Directory (hi guys!), then you'll have seen a popup appear on your device (IOS or macOS) that's trying to take you
to `captive.apple.com`. This is the captive network assistant at work, helping you get a login to the wifi network
you're attempting to connect to. Normally, you just punch in whatever creds you need and off you go.

Oddly, at work, where we auth out via a FortiGate firewall that asks Active Directory to validate the login,
`captive.apple.com` has stopped working. The site returns its `Success` message, but you don't actually get authenticated.
Additionally, if you attempt to get out to another website, you can't get the auth prompt unless the site you're visiting
doesn't use HTTPS, which is becoming increasingly rare.

Because of this, I now run `http://captive.xnode.co.za` in a normal browser window to help me break out (which I won't be 
applying HTTPS to). I'm
also looking for a way to change `captive.apple.com` to `captive.xnode.co.za`, to see if that would fix whatever issue
the FW has with the page at the end of Apple's link.

## Some research

I found this in `/System/Library/SystemConfiguration/CaptiveNetworkSupport.bundle/Contents/Resources/Settings.plist`
under macOS High Sierra:

When Captive Network Assistant loads, it looks for

```
<key>ProbeURL</key>
<string>http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html</string>
```

which contains the following content:

```
curl -i http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html

I'm assuming that if you're on a specific provider network, you get bounced to a specific page so that you can punch
in your login creds, else you get served the default "Safari" authentication dialogue.

So, to disable SIP and edit the file, or not? Hmmm...

## Conclusion

You can try and get your LAN FW admins to do certificate based auth against AD, which removes the need for CNA to try and
authenticate you in the first place. For a few months, I can my own captive website and set it as the homepage on my browser, 
but once the guys "fixed" FW auth against AD, the issue went away, and I killed the VM that my HTTP side ran off of.
